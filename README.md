# LovelyGeek 2012
This theme was the official unveiling of my portfolio for my graduation from The Art Institute of California - Sacramento in June of 2012. To graduate we were required to put together a portfolio site and showcase it at the school's quartlery portfolio show.

This site was built on my lovely 15" <a href="http://apple.com">Apple MacBook Pro</a> using the <a href="http://adobe.com">Adobe</a>&reg; Creative Suite, <a href="http://panic.com/coda/">Coda</a>, <a href="http://panic.com/Transmit/">Transmit</a>, and <a href="http://google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a>. It is powered by <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> and hosted at <a href="http://dreamhost.com">DreamHost</a>.
